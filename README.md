### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrew - I spend a lot of time doing data science-y, quantum computer-y, AI-y, mechanical keyboard-y things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a data scientist at the tech consultancy Waterstons. Here, I am helping build their data science team. Its a fun, varied role, with lots of data science problems to solve, and lots of business development-y stuff to do!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything, really? Fun tech projects, giving talks, the list goes on!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can find me on twitter at [@andrewblance](https://twitter.com/andrewblance), or my more long-form ramblings here on [Medium](https://medium.com/@andrewblance) 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

During my PhD I got the chance to do a lot of âœ¨ exciting âœ¨ research on machine learning and quantum computing methods in particle physics. My papers cover a few topics, including:

- [How to use an autoencoder to do robust anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10384)
- [How can you use quantum computers to build a neural network-esque classification models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07335)
- [Can you use a photonic quantum computer to perform unsupervised anomaly detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03897)
- [I have a function I want to optimise! How can I do this using a quantum annealer?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13945)
