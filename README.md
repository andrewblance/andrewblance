### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

During my PhD I got the chance to do a lot of exciting research on machine learning and quantum computing methods in particle physics. My papers cover a few topics, including:

- [How to use an autoencoder to do robust anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10384)
- [How can you use quantum computers to build a neural network-esque classification models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07335)
- [Can you use a photonic quantum computer to perform unsupervised anomaly detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03897)
- [I have a function I want to optimise! How can I do this using a quantum annealer?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13945)
